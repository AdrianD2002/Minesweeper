# Progress Report

## Week 1

Initial development. Involved drafting the index page format, implementing styles, and basic navigation functionality. We both contributed in deciding and coding the presentation and stylistic choices as we worked together largely in-person.

## Week 2

Implemented Contact and How to Play pages. Adrian worked on the Contact page while Ian worked on the How to Play page.

## Week 3

Complete game functionality from generating game based on difficulty, randomizing mines, digging, flagging, losing on a mine click, and winning on clearing all non-mine spaces. Adrian worked on game initialization (mine randomization, generating table, guaranteeing safe first click, etc.), user input handling (digging, flagging), and adjacent auto digging. Ian worked on detecting win or loss condition, presentation of game results, and implementing audio. Both worked simultaneously on other remaining features (trapped-neighbor count logic, CSS styling, etc.)

## Week 4

Beginning of database implementation and functionalities that used it. Both of us were involved in the logic to handle initializing a database with the correct tables with correct fields. Adrian was responsible for handling account management, while Ian was responsible for handling submissions of game results to the database.

## Week 5

Continued database interaction handling. Adrian was responsible for leaderboard data query and presentation. (Ongoing)
