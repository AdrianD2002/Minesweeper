# Progress Report

## Week 1

Initial development. Involved drafting the index page format, implementing styles, and basic navigation functionality. We both contributed in deciding and coding the presentation and stylistic choices as we worked together largely in-person.

## Week 2

Implemented Contact and How to Play pages. Adrian worked on the Contact page while Ian worked on the How to Play page.
