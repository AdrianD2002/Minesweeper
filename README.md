# Minesweeper
A simple minesweeper website demonstration for our web development course.

## Installation and Usage
1. If not done so already, [install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
2. Locate your XAMPP install (typically C:/xampp/).
3. Open the /htdocs/ folder and do either of the following:

   a) If cloning with git, open your terminal here and run `git clone https://github.com/AdrianD2002/Minesweeper.git`
   
   b) If installing with the ZIP file, unzip the contents into /htdocs/Minesweeper.

5. Run XAMPP and click "Start" for Apache and MySQL.
6. Open the admin settings in MySQL. Create a new user with "csci130" for both the name and password, localhost, and click all privileges.
7. In your web browser, enter "localhost/Data-Browser" in your URL field and hit enter.
8. You should now be in the landing page of the minesweeper website. Have fun!
