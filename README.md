# Minesweeper
A simple minesweeper website demonstration for our web development course.

## Installation and Usage
This website demonstration can be tried with XAMPP running an Apache Server:
1. If not done so already, [install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
2. Locate your XAMPP install (typically C:/xampp/).
3. Open the /htdocs/ folder and do either of the following:
   a) If cloning with git, open your terminal here and run "git clone https://github.com/AdrianD2002/Minesweeper.git"
   b) If installing with the ZIP file, unzip the contents into /htdocs/Minesweeper.
4. Run XAMPP and click "Start" for the Apache server.
5. In your terminal, run the command "ipconfig" and locate your IPv4 address. Copy it.
6. In your web browser, paste your IPv4 in the url followed by "/Minesweeper/index.html" and hit enter.
7. You are now testing the website. Have fun!
